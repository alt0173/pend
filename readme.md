# Installation

Building Pend is simple & easy. You should be able to build and run Pend on Windows, Linux, and MacOS without issue.
Building for WASM *should* work, but will require some setup on your end.

0. install [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
1. Obtain a copy of Pend's github repository (via `git clone` or the `Code` button)
2. Navigate inside the downloaded folder
3. Run the command `cargo build --release`
4. Navigate to the `./target/release` folder to find a binary file (e.g. `pend.exe` on windows), which you can move / rename as you wish.
